# Disney Transport App Concept
This is a conceptual feature for the Disney Parks app, aimed at helping guests navigate across the property using Disney's own transportation systems. The feature allows guests to enter their current location and destination, and receive the fastest, most seamless route using Monorail, Skyliner, Watercraft, Walking paths, and Bus data.

## Key Features
- **Input Options**: Guests can enter their current location manually or use GPS, and select their desired destination.
- **Transport Modes**: The feature suggests routes using the Monorail, Skyliner, Watercraft, Walking paths, and Buses.
- **Step-by-Step Directions**: Guests receive clear, step-by-step instructions on how to get from one place to another!
- **Magical Experience**: Designed with Disney magic in mind, the feature makes navigation part of the fun!
- **Extra Features**: Extras can also be added to allow guests to add choose which modes of transportation they do and dont want to use.
  
## How It Works
1. Guests select their current location (or let the app do it) and choose where they want to go.
2. The app calculates the best route, and also gives them other options, if available.
3. It displays a step by step route that guests can easily follow.

## Example
If a guest wants to travel from Disney's Polynesian Village Resort to EPCOT, the app might suggest:
1. Walk to the TTC (approx. 5 min) OR Take the Monorail from Polynesian to TTC (wait aprox 5 min, ride aprox 15 min)
2. Take the Monorail from TTC to EPCOT (wait aprox 5 min, ride aprox 10 min)
Total time: around 20-35 minutes.

**This is one of many examples that guests dont know is possible. Many guests would love to walk to save an extra 15 minutes, but many dont even know its an option!**
